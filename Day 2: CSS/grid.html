			<blockquote>Don’t let Joe Casabona’s Master’s Degree in Computer Science intimidate you; he is not only an approachable guy, but a born teacher.</i></blockquote>

			<p>Joe started his career almost 20 years ago as a freelance web developer before realizing his true passion, which is sharing his years of knowledge about website development, podcasting and course creation with other business owners, freelancers and entrepreneurs in need. Joe has a gift for breaking down concepts that scare people into bite-sized, approachable pieces of information they can implement in a matter of days.</p>

			<p>Joe’s career trajectory includes 20+ years experience building websites, 16+ years using WordPress, 11+ years teaching at the college level, 7+ years podcasting, plus he is the author of four books, including his latest: <a href="https://htmlvqs.com/">HTML and CSS: Visual QuickStart Guide</a> </p>

			<p>When he’s not creating courses for LinkedIn Learning, you can find Joe spending time with his family, enjoying baseball, or talking too much about Star Wars.</p>
